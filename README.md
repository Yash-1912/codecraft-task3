### Objective
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will
purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

---

### Description
This task implements a decision tree classification model using the
Bank Marketing dataset. The dataset is preprocessed by encoding
categorical variables, and a decision tree classifier is trained
to predict customer purchase decisions.

---

### Dataset
**Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**

**Dataset Source:**
